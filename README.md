Got it 👍 Let me give you a short **description / explanation** of all the contents you built above:

---

### 1. **Backend (Express + MongoDB + JWT)**

* You created an **authentication backend** using **Express**.
* It has two routes:

  * `POST /auth/register` → saves a new user into MongoDB.
  * `POST /auth/login` → checks if the user exists, verifies password, and returns a **JWT token** if valid.
* This token is later used for securing API requests (authorization).

---

### 2. **Frontend (React + Axios)**

* You built two components:

  * **Register.js** → lets a user register by entering email and password. On submit, it sends a request to the backend and shows a success or error message.
  * **Login.js** → lets a user log in. On submit, it calls the backend, gets a token, stores it in `localStorage`, and displays a message.

---

### 3. **App.js (Routing with React Router)**

* You used **react-router-dom** to handle navigation between pages.
* Two routes are defined:

  * `/register` → shows the Register form.
  * `/login` → shows the Login form.
* The `<Link>` components allow navigation between **Login** and **Register** without refreshing the page.

---

### 4. **CSS Styling**

* You added a **navigation bar** at the top.
* Used `flexbox` to center the links and add spacing between "Register" and "Login".
* Gave hover effects and colors to make links look interactive.
* Added styling for login/register forms (input fields, buttons, containers) so they look clean and centered on the page.

---

### 🔑 **Overall Workflow**

1. User opens the app → sees a navbar with **Register** and **Login**.
2. If the user registers, details are saved in MongoDB.
3. If the user logs in, the backend verifies credentials and sends back a **JWT token**.
4. The frontend stores the token (in `localStorage`) for later use in protected routes (like dashboard).

---

⚡ Basically, what you’ve built is the **foundation of a full-stack authentication system** with:

* **Backend**: Express + MongoDB + JWT
* **Frontend**: React + Axios + React Router
* **UI Styling**: CSS for navigation and forms

Would you like me to also give you a **diagram/flow chart** (Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database) so you can visualize how data flows in your app?
